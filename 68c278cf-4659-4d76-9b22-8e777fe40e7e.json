  "description": "<div class=\"main-section\"> <p></p>\n<p>Retina displays are great for viewing photos reading text and pretty much anything else that is viewed on a screen. But what does your website look like on a retina device? If you're not sure then chances are it doesn't look as good as it should.</p> <p>Retina devices can display up to four times as many pixels on screen but only if those pixels exist in the first place. Without a Retina-ready website you're left with a standard resolution site that looks just as pixelated on the new iPad as it does on an old computer screen.</p> <p>With this package you'll receive a full evaluation of your website on a Retina Macbook Pro. Just provide your logo website background navigation and button images in high-resolution (or layered <span class=\"caps\">PSD</span>) and we'll make sure that visitors with Retina devices will see the difference.</p>\n<p></p> </div><div class=\"main-section\"> <h2>What can I expect?</h2> <ul class=\"green-tick-list\"> <li> Add Retina versions of images </li> <li> jQuery plugin to swap images </li> <li> Testing </li> </ul> </div>",
