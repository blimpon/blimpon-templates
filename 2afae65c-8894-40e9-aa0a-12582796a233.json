  "description": "http://tricky3.co.uk/products/html-email-templates\n\nIf you have a Shopify store, there are three broad reasons you may want some custom HTML Email templates:\nYou wshould* like your customers to receive nicely styled order and shipping notification emails. (* because they can make you more money.)\nYou have potential customers in the form of abandoned checkouts that you would like to start a dialogue with.\nYou want to send out branded email marketing communications.\nI can design and build solid cross-device/client HTML Emails and implement them across your notification templates (see a little more about those at Shopifyâ€™s Email Variable Reference wiki.) I can also take the same code and adapt it for use with any Email list management and communications software that you use, like MailChimp, Campaign Monitor, Constant Contact, et al.",
