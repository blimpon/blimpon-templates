  "description": "<div class=\"main-section\"> <p></p>\n<p>Retargeting is a powerful tool that uses online ads to target visitors who leave your website without converting into a customer.</p> <p>For example an Ecommerce store can retarget visitors who place a product in their shopping cart but don't buy. When that visitor leaves and watches a YouTube video they see an ad offering free express shipping if they buy right now.</p> <p>The same applies for websites where visitors never complete a quote request or contact form. All of the top startups and consumer marketing companies in the world are using this tool to re-engage visitors bring them back into the buying funnel and become customers.</p> <p>Retargeting works by installing a cookie on a visitor's browser when they visit your website. If they leave your site without converting they see ads that remind them about your website. Ads could contain a special coupon or an announcement that the special price expires tonight. The options are endless.</p> <p>The best part is that you can set up different ads to target different visitors by the exact page they visited. For instance visitors to a running shoes page will get ads containing running shoes while anyone visiting the high heels category will get a different ad.</p> <p>Almost any business whether you're an Ecommerce site brochure site or startup has something to benefit from retargeting. There is no better tool that remarketing to grow brand awareness on a small budget.</p> <p></p> </div><div class=\"main-section\"> <h2>What can I expect?</h2> <ul class=\"green-tick-list\"> <li> 20 min consultation call with Bogdan </li> <li> Setup Retargeting Pixel on Site </li> <li> Create campaign based on agreed customer group </li> <li> Post Campaign review - 14 days </li> </ul> </div>",
