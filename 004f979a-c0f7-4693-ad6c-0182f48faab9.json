We have Standard (size) and Large(size) delivery options , but  there are surcharges for Standard to certain postcodes and we don’t delivery Large to certain postcodes  . For Large we use our specialist delivery service (which takes 7-15 days) </p><p>\n\nThe system has been set up in a way to deal with this using artificial weights to trigger the different delivery options based on whether customer selects standard or large and where they are in the country. </p><p>\n\nAll our mirrors are FREE delivery </p><p>\n\nWe would like to add some more mirror on-demand (for marketing purposes , to expand the range) and these will be either Standard or Large as follow the above rules, but they will be on-demand which will mean we don’t hold sock and have to order on demand from the supplier following receipt of the customers order. This means the delivery time will be longer 2-4 weeks etc. </p><p>\n\nYour new work should not disrupt any of the above and allow us to add products on-demand with extended delivery times . These new mirrors products will only be available on demand, so the product pages only need to show the on demand delivery options and the Cart should show only the on demand delivery options. </p><p>\n\nThe Shopify theme uses weight to differentiate for shipping options , hence having to use artificial weights </p><p>\n\n\nNetDeco</p><p>\n\nIt is very important your work should on the shipping option for on demand non mirror products should not disrupt the shipping options mirrors which are currently on the site and which follow the same rules as the mirrors on MirrorDeco</p><p>\n\nThe non mirror products (already on the site) need to show only the on demand delivery option on the product pages and in the Cart  and will NOT be free delivery . </p><p>\n\nEverything can be tested in the test theme prior to go live</p>"
