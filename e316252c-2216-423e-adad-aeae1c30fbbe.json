  "description": "http://tricky3.co.uk/products/shopify-design-development\n\nIf you have an existing brand standard, with a logo and look/feel in mind, the I would be happy to build out a custom Shopify theme for your online business to your specifications.\nFollowing an initial kick-off meeting to clarify broad vision and specific goals, a wire-frame layout, with design and user-interface notes, would be fleshed out into a fully functional Shopify store. This assumes that the desired look and feel has been conveyed in some kind of creative briefing document (if you don’t have one—or know what one is—then I can supply my preferred blank for you to complete.)\nA store consists of the following primary templates, which would be produced as deliverables at weekly intervals, with associated milestone payments:\nIndex (home) & Static (“About us” etc.) Pages\nbanners & sliders\nfeatured page/collection/product links\nrecent blog/news excerpts\nmailing list sign-up\ntight social integration\nCollection pages\nintuitive pagination and scrolling options\nadvanced sorting/filtering\nProduct pages\nuser-specified <meta> tags\nproduct image switching & zoom\nsmart social sharing\nThis is a full service offering. I would also provide assistance with payment & shipping provider selection, integration and set-up; DNS config for custom domains; 3rd-party app integrations for accounting, marketing and customer relationship management.",
