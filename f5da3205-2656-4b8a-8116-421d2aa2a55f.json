  "description": "<div>\n<h4>Description</h4>\n<p>Design and develop one calendar on a product page. It has a way to select date before adding product into cart. Fully responsive.</p>\n<p>The calendar will appear in a small window on the product page similar to this: http://prntscr.com/cq4lkz</p>\n<p>2 colors to distinguish products:</p>\n<p>\nRed - #ff0000 - To indicate products which have been added to cart but customer hasn't paid for them</p>\n<p>Green - #00ff00 - To indicate products which the customer has paid for them</p>\n<p>These colors can be configured easily in the Shopify admin.</p>\n<p>The delivery date selected by a customer will be shown as a product properties note in the order.\n</p>\n<p>In case of a conflict: If a date has both paid and unpaid, Red color will be used for the date.</p>\n<p>Certain dates can be made impossible to select. Like, Saturday cannot be selected. This is a code change so Chloe will provide dates that can't be selected</p>\n\n<h4>Limitations</h4>\n<p>\nCustomers must log in first and then they can add into cart. Guest checkout must be turned off, otherwise we can't show them paid orders</p>\n<p>To make this clear to the customer, a popup message or similar will be displayed asking them to log in.</p>\n<p>In responsive, screens may not have everything displayed because of the small available screen width and height.</p>\n</div>",
