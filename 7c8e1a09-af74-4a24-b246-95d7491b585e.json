  "description": "<div class=\"main-section\"> <p></p>\n<p>One of the most powerful tools to win back customers is to re-target people who have added items into their cart but haven't purchased. Cart Re-targeting works by adding a line of code to your website which tracks when customers add an item to their cart but don't check out.</p> <p>Unlike other types of re-targeting this doesn't show people some generic Ad when they leave it emails them directly with a custom email design suited for your customers.</p> <p>You can set when how often and what you want to email customers who haven't purchased. For example you can email a 5% coupon off their cart contents after 3 days and then a 10% coupon after 7 days.</p> <p>Cart retargeting has been proven to have one of the highest ROI's in winning back customers. The best part? Pay nothing until you recover $500 worth of lost revenue.</p>\n<p></p> </div><div class=\"main-section\"> <h2>What can I expect?</h2> <ul class=\"green-tick-list\"> <li> Code Installation </li> </ul> </div>",
