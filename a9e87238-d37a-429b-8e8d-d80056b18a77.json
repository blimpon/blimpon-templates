  "description": "<div class=\"main-section\"> <p></p>\n<p>Ever wanted to allow your customers to pre-order your products on your shopify store? Then this is the right service for you!</p> <p>We will create a new products page that will allow your customers to pre-order your products. You can still sell instock/available products but will also have the option to accept pre-orders by switching to a different and specific template giving you the best of both worlds.</p> <h3>Important Note</h3> <p>According to most laws in most places when selling items as a pre-order you are not supposed to capture the payment immediately. It's usually alright to authorize it but you are only supposed to capture it just before or soon after shipping. It would be wise to use a payment gateway that can authorize for a long period of time. Please check with your payment gateway to determine their authorization period. Most payment gateways have a default authorization period of only 7 days.</p>\n<p></p> </div><div class=\"main-section\"> <h2>What can I expect?</h2> <ul class=\"green-tick-list\"> <li> Create a new template to display pre.order products </li> <li> Adapt the template structure to allow pre-ordering of products </li> <li> Create test pre-order product </li> </ul> </div>",
